# Atlantis

Small customization on top of https://hub.docker.com/r/runatlantis/atlantis to allow using ssh@git urls when cloning private repos.
It'll use the `ATLANTIS_GH_USER` and `ATLANTIS_GH_TOKEN` to login against github

Every new tag/release is build by dockerhub here https://cloud.docker.com/u/uwitedm/repository/docker/uwitedm/atlantis
